### HTML Introduction

How the Web Works:

1. User types a domain name or web address into a browser using an Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
2. DNS server returns a unique number that allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website the user requested.
3. User’s computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. They tell the computer the IP address of the requested domain name.
4. The web server returns the requested page.


### HTML Chapter 1: Structure
HTML provides the basic structure for a web site. HTML consists of elements- characters inside angled brackets. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening and closing tag. Tags act as containers. Each element tells the browser something about the information that lives inside the tags.

Attributes are located within the opening tag and provide additional information about the contents of the element. Attributes consist of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equal sign. Most attributes are only used with certain elements, although there are exceptions. 

The body tag- anything inside this element is displayed in the browser window.

Head tag- contains information about the page and also the title tag.

Title tag- Title of the page; displayed at the top of a browser window.


### HTML Chapter 8: Extra Markup

DOCTYPE precedes any line of code in a web site, as it declares which html version the page is using. 

Comments are used to provide notes that the developer can come back to, and can help others is multiple folks are working on the same project. 

The ID attribute uniquely identifies an element from others on the page. This is important when using CSS to style.

Class attribute is similar to ID, but it’s a way to identify several elements in a page.

Block elements reserve their own line in the code. 
	
Inline elements continue on the same line as their neighbors.
	
The div element creates a block-level box that groups a set of elements together. 
	
A span element is an inline element that can contain sections of text in which no other suitable element can be used to differentiate it.
	
iframe is used to embed another document into the web page.
	
Src specifies the url of another page that is referenced.
	
The meta element contains information about the web page and lives inside the head element. It is an empty element. The information contained doesn’t appear in the page, but contains useful information provided to search engines, such as description and keywords.


### HTML Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
Header and footer elements can be used to create headers and footers for an entire page or for a specific section of a page, such as an article or section.
	
The navigation element contains the major navigational blocks on a site.
	
Article elements contain parts of a page that stand alone and could potentially be syndicated, such as a blog entry or forum post.
	
The aside element, when inside an article, contains information related to the article but not essential to the overall meaning. When outside, it contains information related to the entire page, such as links to other parts of the site or a search box.
	
Section elements group related content together, but should not be used to wrap an entire page.


### HTML Chapter 18: Process & Design

WHO?		Every website should be designed with the target audience in mind.
WHY?		Understand the motivations for why someone would come to a site.
		Identify the specific goals of the visitor.
WHAT?		What are they trying to achieve? 
		Look at the reasons why and identify what they need to meet their goals.

Site maps are diagrams of the structure of the site and are important when creating the layout of a site.

A wireframe is a basic mockup of how the page will be designed. This is crucial to making sure all of the necessary site information is included.

		
### JS Introduction

JavaScript creates more interactive web pages by accessing and modifying content while it is being viewed. 

It responds to what the user does, such as selecting a particular button or link or hovering over an element.


### JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming
A script is a series of instructions a computer can follow to achieve a particular goal.

Writing a script requires first defining the goal of the script then identifying the individual tasks necessary to achieve the goal.

High level views of the tasks can be represented using a flowchart.
